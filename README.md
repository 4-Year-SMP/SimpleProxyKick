# SimpleProxyKick
Simple Plugin for configurable Backend Server Kicks to be Made Proxy-Wide ones

## Purpose
Our server has an anti-AFK plugin, however, it only kicks on the backend level. This plugin makes kicks with specific reasons (i.e. AFK kicks) be done on the proxy-level so they're kicked from the network and not just sent to the hub.

## Commands and Permissions
`/simpleproxykickreload` (simpleproxykick.reload)
Reloads the configuration
